# Code-a-mon!

This project will include 3 different decorator patterns based off the Gang of Four.
The recommended decorator patterns will be used to complete this project. 

# Pattern 1 - Decorator 

This pattern will be used to integrate changes of behaviors within program.

# Pattern 2 - Factory

This pattern will be used to create new characters within the program by having a
seperate factory method to call.

# Pattern 3 - Mediator

This pattern will be used to restrict direct communication between the objects during 
the battle, captures or purchases. This will allow for more mediated communication.

... More to come!
