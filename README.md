# Code-a-mon!

This project will include 3 different decorator patterns based off the Gang of Four.
The recommended decorator patterns will be used to complete this project. 

# Pattern 1 - Decorator 

This pattern is focused around the evolution and stats of a code-a-mon, and allows
for a change in value during an evolution.

# Pattern 2 - Factory

This pattern is focused around the creation of trainers and codeamons, and allows
use of a factory class to easily create and store trainer/codeamon values. 

# Pattern 3 - Mediator

This pattern is focused around the the battle and shop operations. I used a mediator class with multi threading to simulate
a tick-based world. Only one operation runs at a time.
